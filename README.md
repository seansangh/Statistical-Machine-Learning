<b>Density Estimation & Classification:</b>
<br>
This project involves using a MNIST dataset containing images of digits "0" and "1" and involves four tasks: feature extraction, parameter calculation, implementation of Na√Øve Bayes classifiers, and prediction of labels for the test data using the classifiers. Finally, calculating the accuracy of the predictions.

<br>
<b>K-Means:</b>
<br>
Use the K-means algorithm to implement two different strategies for choosing initial cluster centers.
<br>
<br>
<b>Neural Networks & Deep Learning:</b>
<br>
Understand the whole process of compiling different layers (Convolutional Layer, Fully-Connected Layer, Pooling Layer, Activation Layer, Loss function) of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the visual classification task. And compile an evaluation code to evaluate the trained CNN to obtain the training and testing results
